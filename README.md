 ## Physics
 The game is made to be used in VR, using the ability to look up/down and left/right as part of the game play. The hero moves forward while the world moves around the character. This allows the user to spend most of the time looking in the forward direction and not having to rotate the head too much. The game might require the user to look off to the left or right up or down depending on the design of the level.
