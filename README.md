 ## Physics
 The game is made to be used in VR, using the ability to look up/down and left/right as part of the game play. The hero moves right/left and at the same time the world moves along with the character. This allows the user to spend most of the time looking forward. Only occasionally will the game require the user to rotate the head as part of the game mechanics.
